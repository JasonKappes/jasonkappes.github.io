								<h1>And Beyond</h1>

								<p>
									And Beyond is a 3D space-based exploration platformer with unique planet traversal and exploration mechanics. <br />
									This game was created as a Capstone project with a team of four over six months. I was one of the two game <br />
									programmers on the team, with the other two members being game designers. This was created utilizing the <br />
									Unity game engine and developed with C#.

											<h3>Gameplay Trailer</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This video acts as a brief overview of the major gameplay elements. I had a key role in the development of most sytems. <br />
										Most notably I developed the traversal mechanics, camera manipulation, A.I. movement, pickup mechanics, and cannon mechanics.

											<h3>Longer Length Gameplay</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This is a longer form version of the gameplay. The idea of the game is that the player must rebuild his spaceship.<br />
										To get these ship parts, the player needs to traverse to different planets. Some of the time, the player will need to <br />
										to trade with the alien species, called "nauts", to get a ship part. From a gameplay perspective, there was a major <br />
										focus on getting the traversal mechanics to feel well and transition smoothly inbetween one another. The camera <br />
										manipulation was a factor for this as well.</p>

								<p>
									| GameObject: The user can inherit from the GameObject class and thus utilize many engine-level capabilities.<br />
									| 3D Object Collision: This supports collisions between 3D objects. The user can select a Bsphere, OBB, or AABB collision model for any object.<br />
									| 3D Mouse Selection: This allows the user to detect collisions between mouse and a 3D object.<br />
									| Terrain Management: Terrain generation and customization from user files and efficient terrain collision.<br />
									| Asset Management: Texture, Model, and Shader file management.<br />
									| Rendering: Objects can be rendered as 2D or 3D objects. A basic graphics engine was used for shading, texturing, and modeling of 3D objects.<br />
									| Alarm: The user can receive function callbacks after a defined amount of time.<br />
									| World Editor: The world can be seen and world data (position/rotation/scale) changed for 3D objects in realtime.<br />
									| Serialization: Gameobject world data can be changed in world edit mode and updated upon a regular game execution.<br />
