									And Beyond is a 3D space-based exploration platformer with unique planet traversal and exploration mechanics. <br />
									This game was created as a Capstone project with a team of four over six months. I was one of the two game <br />
									programmers on the team, with the other two members being game designers. This was created utilizing the <br />
									Unity game engine and developed with C#.

											<h3>Gameplay Trailer</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This video acts as a brief overview of the major gameplay elements. I had a key role in the development of most sytems. <br />
										Most notably I developed the traversal mechanics, camera manipulation, A.I. movement, pickup mechanics, and cannon mechanics.

											<h3>Longer Length Gameplay</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This is a longer form version of the gameplay. The idea of the game is that the player must rebuild his spaceship.
										To get these ship parts, the player needs to traverse to different planets. Some of the time, the player will need to
										to trade with the alien species, called "nauts", to get a ship part. From a gameplay perspective, there was a major
										focus on getting the traversal mechanics to feel well and transition smoothly inbetween one another. The camera
										manipulation was a factor for this as well.</p>

									<h3>Development Challenges and Problems Solved</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									• Gravity: This was a mechanic that was central to the game because it dictated how all entities behave on a planet. <br />
									I added a gravity field (spherical collider) to each planet to help delineate what planet an entity is pulled too. <br />
									A strategy pattern was used to enable/disable gravity when needed.<br /><br />
									• Space Clarity/ Camera Manipulation: Giving the player different vision levels was very important. Since there are <br />
									planets and areas that the player would need to travel to, we gave the camera three different rigs to operate from <br />
									at any time. So the player could have close-up micro camera views and also far-away views to help see the planets around. <br /><br />
									• AI and Player Interactions: There were a few AI and player interactions that had many edge cases associated with them. <br />
									If the player held an item, an AI on the same planet would chase the player, stun, and pickup that item. Likewise, if the <br />
									AI held an item, the player could stun the AI, the AI would drop the item, and the player could pickup an item. The first  <br />
									step in the developmental process was telling the correct AI (on the player's planet) to chase the player. I implemented <br />
									a manager that helped manage the AI/Planet pairs that existed and then using this to trigger the correct AI to chase <br />
									the player. Many iterations were needed to resolve the various edge cases surrounding the ownership of items and how <br />
									player/AI collisions affected the state and movement of an item.<br />
